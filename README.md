# UNSPL

Another wallpapper cli utility based on unsplash

## Usage

You can quickly change your wallpaper to a random one by simply executing the tool.

```
$ unspl
⬓ Fetching a new image from Unsplash... Done!
```

Or you can pick from one of 3 sources - `random`, `daily` and `weekly`

```
$ unspl daily
⬓ Fetching a new image from Unsplash... Done!
```

Filtering is possible by passing one or more `--keyword` flags.

```
$ unspl random --keyword nature
⬓ Fetching a new image from Unsplash... Done!
```
